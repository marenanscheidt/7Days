    <div class="text">You can either reheat from the frozen or thawed state. From frozen will take much longer however. Your best bet is to take out of the freezer at least 24 hours in advance from when you want to reheat. Let it defrost in the fridge. Either way here is what you do! Preheat oven to 350, cover pan tightly with foil. It will be ready to eat when the sauce is bubbling to the surface, about 30-40 minutes if completely thawed, 45-50 if partially thawed and and hour plus if frozen. If it is not browned enough on top remove foil and let it cook for a little longer or put it under the broiler for a few minutes. Cooked pasta can be stored in airtight containers in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. If possible, store pasta and sauce separately. To reheat, drop pasta in boiling water for a few seconds; drain. Or, freeze cooked pasta for up to 2 weeks: Cool the pasta slightly, then drizzle with a little olive oil or cooking oil and toss gently. Spoon into airtight containers or freezer bags. Defrost a bag of frozen pasta in a colander in the sink by running tepid water over it. Or, drop the contents of the bag or container into boiling water. Thawing and warming time depends on the amount of pasta, but plan on about 2 minutes for small amounts.</div>
